  Migrate organically grown Python src packages to explicit directed folder trees: parent modules

  and each package directly depends on at most one sibling. Use this skill whenever a user asks to
  clean up a Python package structure or import graph, untangle upward/sideways/circular imports,
  split a monolith into packages, add import-linter architecture contracts, enforce folder boundaries
  in AGENTS.md, or transfer APB2-style import rules to another codebase.

# Directed Folder Imports

Turn a package that grew by convenience into a package whose directory tree states its dependency
direction. Treat this as an ownership migration, not a file-shuffling or linter-silencing exercise.

## The recursive law

For a package `A/` with child packages `A/B/`, `A/C/`, and `A/D/`:

```text
A/*.py  -> A/B/*    allowed: a parent module imports downward
A/*.py  -> A/C/*    allowed: a parent module imports downward
A/B/*   -> A/*.py   forbidden: a child imports upward
A/C/*   -> A/*.py   forbidden: a child imports upward
A/B/*   -> A/C/*    allowed only as a declared one-way sibling edge
A/C/*   -> A/B/*    forbidden after B -> C: sibling edges never reverse
A/B/*   -> A/D/*    forbidden while B -> C exists: B already has one sibling dependency
```

At every folder level:

1. Children never import modules directly in their parent folder.
2. Sibling-package imports must form a directed acyclic graph.
3. Each child package may directly depend on **at most one** sibling package.
4. Parent modules may import and compose any of their direct children.
5. Apply the same rule recursively inside every child package.

“Depends on at most one sibling” means one direct sibling-package target. A chain such as
`B -> C -> D` is valid when every edge is one-way; `B -> C` and `B -> D` is not. Modules directly in
one directory may import one another when that directory is one component, but cycles remain defects.

When a child needs two sibling packages, do not declare a broader exception. Change the ownership
tree using one of these two corrections:

- move the code that composes both siblings into their parent; or
- when the dependent package owns both collaborators, make those collaborators its children, so its
  own parent-level modules compose them.

The folder tree must express the correction. A comment, allow-list, or name such as `application`,
`gui`, or `facade` does not relax the rule.

Directory placement also expresses ownership:

- Move a parent-level module used and owned by only one child into that child.
- Keep a module in the parent only when it implements the parent's external boundary or genuinely
  composes more than one child.
- Do not move a child-owned module upward merely because it imports an external library.
- Do not create `shared`, `common`, `utils`, `model`, or `helpers` as an ownership-free parking lot.

This is a directed folder tree, not a claim that nested folders are automatically good. If the same
pair of siblings needs edges in both directions, or one sibling needs several peers, redraw ownership
instead of broadening the permission.

## Start with evidence

Do not move files on the first pass.

1. Read the closest project instructions, packaging configuration, CI, and architecture docs.
2. Inspect `git status` and preserve unrelated work. Establish the existing test/lint baseline.
3. Identify the actual import root (`src/<package>`, a flat package, or several roots).
4. Inventory production modules, public entry points, package data/resources, tests, and imports.
5. Run the project's existing dependency tool first. For Python, prefer Import Linter/Grimp over a
   new AST walker. Add a tool only after confirming none exists.
6. Record current violations as edges, not impressions:
   `source module -> imported module -> upward | sibling edge | second sibling target | cycle |
   framework leak`.

When scanning an integration package, classify definitions by responsibility and by the values
they return, not only by imported libraries:

- Dash/HTML components, Plotly figure specifications, HTTP responses, view labels, and browser
  state remain presentation concerns even when represented as plain dictionaries or strings.
- Workflows that accept plain inputs and return application/domain values belong in an application
  or feature package when their responsibility survives replacing the GUI.
- Domain computation belongs in the domain package that names it.
- Do not create a sibling named `utilities` for everything the GUI happens to call. Name extracted
  modules after their use case or domain responsibility and give each a deliberate public API.

Read [migration-playbook.md](references/migration-playbook.md) for the evidence tables and phased
migration sequence.

## Design the target tree

Describe every intended folder in one sentence: what it owns, what it may import, and what imports
it. If that sentence cannot be written, the boundary is not ready.

Use this placement test for each module:

| Evidence | Placement |
| --- | --- |
| Owns one child's vocabulary or behavior and is consumed only there | Move into that child |
| Translates between two children | Parent composition module |
| Constructs implementations and injects them into consumers | Parent composition root |
| Defines storage/framework declarations | Adapter/schema child, independent of computation |
| Holds values one parent workflow consumes | Inward data child |
| Child needs one sibling | Declare the one-way edge and prove the reverse edge is absent |
| Child needs two siblings | Move composition to the parent or nest the owned collaborators |
| Merely re-exports a child object | Delete it or move the public boundary deliberately |

Prefer client-owned capabilities when allowing `B -> C` would create a reverse edge or give `B` a
second sibling dependency. Put a small `Protocol` or `Callable` shape in `B`, let the implementation
conform structurally, and have the parent inject it. Simple values can be translated at the parent
boundary. Do not add such indirection when one honest one-way sibling edge already satisfies the law.

Keep Pydantic/ORM/API schemas at storage boundaries. A storage model should not acquire runtime
behavior merely to avoid an import; project it into plain runtime values at a parent boundary.

## Choose a migration shape

Select one explicitly:

- **In-place slice:** suitable when the public imports are small and the current tests give strong
  coverage. Move one coherent dependency slice at a time.
- **New namespace/strangler:** suitable when legacy imports are dense or the replacement is a large
  redesign. Build the directed package beside the old one, cut one external entry point over, then
  delete the legacy implementation.

Do not maintain two implementations indefinitely. Compatibility imports are allowed only for an
explicitly preserved public API, with an owner and removal condition. Internal forwarding modules,
fallback imports, and duplicate implementations are carpets.

Before a substantial migration, write a plan and obtain approval. The plan must show:

- current and target trees;
- allowed and forbidden edges;
- module moves with ownership reasons;
- public API/resource-path consequences;
- the cutover and deletion point;
- enforcement and verification commands.

## Migrate in slices

For each slice:

1. Move the lowest-dependency values/schemas first when they already have a clear inward owner.
2. Move the behavior owned by that boundary; update every internal import directly.
3. Add or move the parent adapter/facade/composition root that connects children when a child would
   otherwise need a second sibling or a reverse edge.
4. Move the corresponding tests to mirror the production ownership.
5. Run focused tests and the import contract before taking the next slice.
6. Delete superseded code once the entry point uses the new path.

Prefer real moves over copies. Keep `__init__.py` empty unless it is an intentionally supported
public import surface; re-exporting everything conceals the defining module and the dependency
edge. Never use dynamic imports, `sys.path` manipulation, type-check-only imports, or local imports
to fool the graph.

If the worktree is dirty, preserve it. Create a checkpoint commit only when the user authorizes a
commit; otherwise report the exact pre-existing state and keep the migration diff separable.

## Enforce the proven graph

Use Import Linter for Python package edges. Ruff is a formatter/linter and cannot express an
arbitrary recursive folder dependency graph. Read [import-linter.md](references/import-linter.md)
and create one exhaustive contract per meaningful container:

- list parent modules above their children;
- order permitted one-way sibling edges and put unrelated siblings on the same `|` layer;
- add nested contracts for child packages with their own internal tree;
- add focused forbidden contracts for framework/backend isolation;
- run `lint-imports` from the ordinary lint/check target and CI.

An exhaustive layers contract proves direction and acyclicity, but it can permit one package to
import several lower siblings. Add one focused Grimp/architecture test that counts each child
package's direct sibling-package targets and fails above one. Use architecture tests similarly for
an intentionally empty package marker or a public CLI that may import only one facade. Do not
duplicate the entire import graph in AST tests.

Add the concise rule to project agent instructions only after the target tree is agreed. Use the
copyable block in [agents-guidance.md](references/agents-guidance.md), replacing placeholders with
verified paths and commands.

## Verify completion

Run, in this order:

1. focused tests for each moved slice;
2. Import Linter and cycle detection;
3. formatter, linter, and strict type checker;
4. the complete repository test gate proportionate to the change;
5. package/wheel/resource smoke tests when modules or package data moved;
6. public entry-point/import smoke tests;
7. non-blocking architecture diagnostics, interpreted rather than optimized.

Report:

- the before/after tree and import edges;
- modules moved, deleted, or deliberately retained in the parent;
- public compatibility decisions;
- contracts added and what each one proves;
- verification results and any remaining legacy island.

The work is complete when the code, folder tree, linter contracts, tests, and agent guidance say the
same thing. A clean linter result obtained through ignores, aliases, or indirection is not complete.

## Failure modes to reject

- Creating folders to improve a metric without a named ownership boundary.
- Moving all records into `models.py` or all helpers into `utils.py`.
- Letting one child depend directly on two siblings because the edges are acyclic.
- Putting a facade inside one child when it thereby gains a second sibling dependency or reverse edge.
- Letting a child import its parent's configuration or errors.
- Solving excess sibling dependencies with a `shared/` package.
- Enforcing an imagined target graph before checking real imports and public APIs.
- Claiming Ruff enforces the rule.
- Keeping old and new paths alive through broad re-exports.
- Refactoring the whole repository when one bounded package can establish the new rule first.

## Improve this skill from use

After completing a task with this skill, reflect on whether its instructions or resources revealed a
gap, ambiguity, stale instruction, avoidable friction, or error. If concrete evidence surfaced, include
a brief `Skill feedback` note in the handoff or final response that names the affected file or section
and proposes the smallest useful correction. Do not invent feedback when no issue surfaced, and do not
edit the skill during an unrelated task without the user's authorization.
